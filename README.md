# ABOUT

This is a reporsitory for a Reconnaissance tool that I am developing. It will be built on Python and Bash Script. I will be commiting to the main directory from time to time. The main inspiration to create this tool comes from Nahamsec's lazyrecon and JoshuaMart's AutoRecon.


## What It Will Do:

This tool will mainly be used to automate the boring and lengthy reconnaissance part. I will try to automate as much things as possible.
